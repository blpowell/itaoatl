# Is There Anything On At The Liberty?

Site which will let you know if there is anything on at the [Liberty Statium](http://www.liberty-stadium.com) in Swansea so you can avoid the traffic!

Written (Badly) in RoR to help me get to know the language/framework 

## Resources

The following articles/links were of great use when building this:

* [Data Scraping and More With Ruby, Nokogiri, Sinatra and Heroku](http://hunterpowers.com/data-scraping-and-more-with-ruby-nokogiri-sinatra-and-heroku/)
* Deploying Rails App on Amazon Web Services [Part 1](http://dennissuratna.com/rails-deployment-aws1) & [Part 2](http://dennissuratna.com/rails-deployment-aws2)
* [Sample REST API in Rails](http://codedecoder.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/sample-rest-api-example-in-rails/)

## API

There is a basic API which allows you to view [all events](http://ec2-54-76-144-105.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/events) or to just get the [next event](http://ec2-54-76-144-105.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/events/next)
